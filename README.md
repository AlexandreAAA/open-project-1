### Unity Open Project #1: Chop Chop
# Devlog 4: Packaging content with Addressable Assets

You've landed on the repository for the first Unity **Open Project**, an initiative where Unity and the community collaborate together to create a small **open-source game demo**. The first game is an action-adventure titled _Chop Chop_ ([more info](https://open.codecks.io/unity-open-project-1/decks/32/card/126-what-is-this)).

This branch in particular (`devlogs/4-addressable-assets`) contains the **demo assets** associated with the fourth "devlog" video, which explores how we tackled the complex requirements we had for input on this project. You can watch the video [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/XIHINtB2e1U) 🎞

**Note:** This branch doesn't necessarily contain the full project, but a trimmed-down version which focuses on the subject of the devlog. We did it so easier to explore and learn from it. In time, we might make small updates to this branch or backport fixes when needed, but don't expect it to be updated with new features and to stay in sync with `main`.

To find the full project and contribute to it, go to the [main branch](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1).

## Unity version
Like the [main branch](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1) this demo runs on **Unity 2020.3 LTS**. Upcoming 2020.3 LTS patches should work fine, but compatibility with newer versions (2021.1 and later) is not guaranteed.

## License
The assets contained in this branch are covered by the same open-source license that covers the rest of the game ([Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/blob/main/LICENSE)), so you are free to use them for your own projects.

## Contribute
Open Projects is an open-source game, so we'd love your contributions! However, we don't take contributions on this branch so please don't open PRs against it.
To take part in the development, go to [the main branch](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1) and find all the instructions on how to contribute in its [Readme](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/blob/main/README.md).
